/* This header is included to avoid circular dependencies.
 * The original cause: Race_datum (race.h) requires the enum Map_type, which was
 * originally in map.h.  However, Map_type_datum (map.h) requires City_role from
 * ai.h; and ai.h requires Race_skill from race.h.  Since all of these are enums
 * we cannot resolve this dependency without creating a new header just for enum
 * Map_type.
