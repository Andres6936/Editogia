A city is an area where people live and work together.  A large part of \
Edigotia lies in managing your city and helping it to grow.\n\
\n\
The <link=world map>world</link> is dotted with cities, each of which belongs \
to a certain <link=kingdom>kingdom</link> and <link=race>race</link>.  These \
cities are often connected by <link=road>roads</link> to facilitate trade.  \
Inside the cities there is a number of <link=citizens>citizens</link>, \
<link=building>buildings</link>, and a <link=city map>map</link> which has \
<link=area>areas</link> built on it.  Cities may also house <link=nobles>nobles\
</link> and <link=military>armies</link>.\

	_type("Game Concept");
	_text("\
Kingdoms are loosely affiliated sets of <link=city>cities</link>.  Usually, \
kingdoms are tied to <link=race>races</link>; each race has one kingdom \
associated with it, and a kingdom is made up entirely of that race.  This \
makes the concept of \"race\" and \"kingdom\" closely related, and you may see \
them used somewhat interchangably.  However, while \"race\" refers to the \
particular attributes of <link=nobles>nobles</link> and <link=citizens>citizens\
</link>, \"kingdom\" refers to a political structure.\n\
\n\
Kingdoms are based on a political hierarchy.  Each kingdom has one capital \
city, the home of the <link=monarch>king or queen</link> of the kingdom.  The \
rest of the kingdom is split into several <link=duchy>duchies</link>, each of \
which has its own capital city, which is the home of the <c=ltgreen>duke or \
duchess<c=/>.  Within each duchy are several cities, run by <c=ltgreen>mayors\
<c=/>.\n\
\n\
Each mayor is expected to obey the rule of its duke, and each duke is \
duty-bound to the king.  The most concrete form of this fealty is seen in \
taxes; all cities owe a certain monthly sum to their duke, while each duchy \
must pay monthly taxes to the king.  The end result is that the kingdom's \
capital city enjoys great wealth.\n\
\n\
In addition to taxes, cities may be asked to come to the aid of their lord, \
and of their duchy in general.  This may involve sending <link=food>food\
</link> to cities in need, <link=conscription>conscripting</link> citizens for \
service in the royal <link=army>army</link>, or changing their laws to match \
the demands of the lord.  If a city performs well in the eyes of their lord, \
they will gain royal <link=relations>favor</link>, improving their political \
standing.  Favors are a two-way street; if your city is in need, whether it be \
a food shortage, impending military invasion, or other issue, asking your lord \
for help is often the best solution.  However, asking for help too often will \
damage your favor, and your lord may eventually cut you off altogether.\n\
\n\
While you start the game in control of a normal city, this is not necessarily \
your eternal fate.  There are ways to climb the political ladder, advancing to \
the status of a duke and even king or queen.  This simplest - and most \
dangerous - is a military invasion, taking the duchy seat as your own.  This \
will almost always provoke a response of force from the king, unless you have \
their support.  A safer option would be political maneuvering.  If you can \
gain great favor with the king, while simultaneously turning the king against \
your duke, they may instate you as a new duke.  Alternatively, if the duke \
dies and leaves no heir, they may select a very close friend to inherit their \
dynasty.\n\
\n\
Similarly to how cities have often-complex relationships, different kingdoms \
have their own relationships with each other.  Kingdoms that share a border \
may develop tensions, and issues of trade and war can further strain them.  If \
two kingdoms end up going to war, the individual cities inside them will be \
expected to cut off all trade with each other, and may be asked to contribute \
soldiers to the war effort.\

The monarch (king or queen) is a <link=nobles>noble</link> who rules over a \
<link=kingdom>kingdom</link>.  This honor is generally passed on from \
generation to generation; when the current ruler passes away, their eldest \
heir is named king or queen after them.  If there is no eligable heir, there \
is a <link=succession crisis>succession crisis</link>, and the kingdom will be \
without a leader until one is selected (by any surviving royal family) or \
someone <link=coup>seizes the throne</link>.\n\
\n\
The <link=city>city</link> that the monarch rules over is the de facto \
capital of the kingdom.  This city usually enjoys a great surplus of wealth, \
as all <link=duchy>duchies</link> under its rule must pay taxes to the city.  \
This frees the city up to spend its time and <link=resources>resources</link> \
on matters of state, rather than securing <link=trade>trades</link> for \
wealth.  The monarch is also expected to tend to the needs of its duchies, who \
in turn will come to the aid of their cities, so much of this wealth will wind \
up back in the hands of the kingdom's cities.\n\
\n\
The monarch enjoys the power to declare the <link=laws>laws</link> of the \
kingdom.  They can declare <link=war>war</link> against another kingdom, \
<link=trade embargo>trade embargoes</link> against a kingdom or city, \
<link=prohibition>prohibit</link> the produce, sale or use of various \
resources, or various other laws.  Cities may choose to disobey the law of the \
monarch, but will lose <link=favor>favor</link> or may see their ruler removed \
from power.\n\
\n\
As the ruler of the kingdom, the monarch is often under threat of \
assassination.  Foreign powers may benefit from the chaos caused when a \
monarch dies, and even the subjects of the monarch may want to depose their \
ruler, either to disrupt unfair rule or for a chance to seize the throne.  For \
this reason, most monarch will want to keep a sizable <link=army>army</link> \
to defend their city, and a strong <link=city guard>city guard</link> to \
thwart assassins.\

A duchy is a district of a <link=kingdom>kingdom</link> under the rule of a \
<c=ltgreen>duke or duchess<c=/>.  A duchy consists of several <link=city>cities\
</link>, one of which is home to and ruled by the duke, known as the \
<c=ltgreen>duchy seat<c=/>.  The duchy seat collects monthly taxes from its \
subject cities, allowing it to focus on matters of state rather than securing \
a strong economy.  However, cities in need will often turn to their duke for \
aid, so this tax wealth is often redistributed to the duchy's cities.\n\
\n\
The duke is allowed to write the <link=laws>laws</link> for its subject \

<link=prohibition>prohibition</link> of various <link=resources>resources\

\n\
When a duke or duchess passes away, rule generally passes to their eldest \
heir.  If there is no eligable heir, it falls to the monarch to select a new \

the region has the greatest <link=favor>favor</link> with them.  Dukes may be \

Nobles are members of the ruling class in Edigotia.  At the start of a new \
game, you control a single noble of your design, who acts as the ruler of your \
<link=city>city</link>.  This noble <c=white>is<c=/> you!  If they die, and \
you have no other nobles under your control, your game is over.  For this \
reason, keeping your nobles safe, and obtaining more, is very important.\n\
\n\
Nobles fill a wide range of purposes (<c=magenta>for a full list, see \
<link=list of noble roles>list of noble roles</link>).  The most important, \
and the first role your noble will take, is the <link=governor>governor</link> \
of your city.  As you gain more nobles, you can assign them other roles via \
the <link=nobles screen>noble control screen</link>.\n\
\n\
Each noble is unique.  In addition to more-or-less cosmetic details like their \
name, sex, and <link=coat of arms>coat of arms</link>, they have two \
<link=noble traits>traits</link> and a variety of <link=noble skills>skills\
</link>.  The traits are innate to your noble and cannot be changed.  They \
provide some bonuses (or in some cases, penalties) to various areas of the \
game, and may alter how your city grows.  The skills may be increased through \
training, and represent how good your noble is at the various jobs they can \
take on.\n\
\n\
Your noble is an important dignitary.  In addition to overseeing \
<link=diplomacy>diplomatic</link> and <link=trade>trade</link> agreements, \
they can attend various social functions at home or in foreign cities.  These \
events are a good opportunity for your noble to meet a future husband or \
wife.  Marriages can be founded in romance, if both parties are lucky enough \
to be attracted to each other, but more often they are the product of a \
political agreement to bring two cities closer together.\n\
\n\
After your noble has wed a spouse, you can start trying to sire some heirs.  \
Heirs are a crucial mid-game goal, as they allow you to continue your \
<link=dynasty>lineage</link> and continue playing the game after the first \
generation of nobles has passed away.  The children of two nobles will inherit \
a random trait from each one.  There is a small random chance for them to \
instead receive a completely random trait, introducing some change into the \
family.  If the parents are related (second cousins or closer), then there is \
a chance that the child will receive a random <c=ltred>bad<c=/> trait!\

political structures.  Each <link=city>city</link> in the world belongs to a \

<link=city radius>city radius</link>, they tend to be more useful or important \
than buildings.\n\
\n\
Your city always starts with one area - the <link=keep>keep</link>.  The keep \
appears at the center of your city, and provides you with the basic support to \
start growing.  While you can close or destroy the keep, it is not \
recommended!\n\
\n\
Many areas interact with the city map to reap the resources it contains.  It \
is important to carefully consider the placement of your areas in order to \
maximize their effectiveness.\n\
\n\
Areas can be built by selecting the \"Build Area\" option from the \
<link=main screen>main screen</link>.  They are organized into several \
categories.  Areas cost a certain amount of resources to build (usually \
<link=gold>gold</link>, <link=stone>stone</link>, and/or <link=wood>wood\
</link>), and will usually require several days of construction before they \
can be used.\n\
\n\
Once open, some areas will automatically employ citizens, while others must be \
interacted with via the <link=building status screen>building status screen\

areas will often charge a maintenance fee every day.  The only way to stop \

area, or <link=destroying areas>destroying</link> it altogether.  Closing an \
area is free, but it will usually cost some gold to re-open it.  Destroying an \
area costs money as well, and is irreversible.\n\
\n\
Many areas produce resources, such as <link=farm>farms</link> and \
<link=mine>mines</link>.  Others provide <link=housing>housing</link> for your \
citizens, and still more are supportive infrastructure; for instance, \
<link=pasture>pastures</link> provide space to hold livestock, while \
<link=park>parks</link> provide a space for your citizens to relax, improving \

Buildings are a core part of your <link=city>city</link>.  Adding buildings to \
your city allow you to create new resources, improve various areas of city \
administration, and train special <link=citizens>citizens</link>.\n\
\n\
In order to add buildings to your city, you will need one or more \
<link=area>areas</link> which support buildings.  These areas are essentially \
ground upon which buildings may be placed.  Fortunately, your city always \
starts with a <link=keep>keep</link>, which supports up to 6 buildings.  The \
most common way to support more buildings is by adding a \
<link=plaza>plaza</link> or <link=marketplace>marketplace</link>, both of \
which support buildings.\n\
\n\
Buildings fill a variety of purposes.  The most common is to employ citizens \
to produce resources.  This production is either a raw output which each \
worker creates, or a form of manufacturing which converts one or more \
resources into something new.  Employed citizens almost always need to be paid \
wages; most buildings also have a daily maintenance cost which must be paid.  \
You can stop paying these fees by <link=closing areas and buildings>closing\

\n\
The world map is a flat map of the known world.  The world is flat, and \
exploring beyond the edge of the map will lead to nothing but open seas and \
eventually the edge of the world!\n\
\n\
The world is composed of several continents, separated by ocean.  The world's \
<link=temperature>temperature</link> is colder towards the north and south \
ends, and warmest at the equator.  The continents are covered with a variety \
of <link=mountainous>mountain ranges</link> and long flat areas, and are more \
likely to be flat near the coats.  There are complex patterns of rainfall.  \
Prevailing winds go from west to east.  As the wind travels over ocean, it \
builds up moisture, resulting in higher <link=rainfall>rainfall</link> near \
west coasts.  If the wind hits a mountain range, it will result in high \
rainfall to the west of the mountains, and a much drier climate to the east.  \
For this reason, you will often see areas of <link=desert>desert</link> to the \
east of mountains.\n\
\n\
Each tile of the world map has a different <link=map type>terrain</link>.  \
This terrain determines what the <link=city map>map</link> of a <link=city>city\
</link> built on that tile will look like.  Terrain is determined by altitude, \
temperature and rainfall.  Areas with low altitude and moderate temperature \
and rainfall, like <link=plains>plains</link>, are generally the easiest to \
survive in.  However, all terrains are survivable and offer different types of \
<link=resources>resources</link>, <link=crops>crops</link> and \
<link=animals>wildlife</link> to <link=hunting>hunt</link>.  A city can thrive \
anywhere by exploiting the unique benefits of the terrain!\n\
\n\
Large areas of the world are claimed by various <link=kingdom>kingdoms\
</link>.  Each kingdom is dotted with cities, connected by <link=road>roads\
</link>.  Roads are just one (albeit the most important) of many \
<link=world map improvements>improvements</link> that can be built on the \
world map.  When you start a new game, the part of the world claimed by the \
kingdom you belong to is revealed, along with a small area outside of it.  \
Additionally, any coastlines somewhat close to your kingdom are revealed.  You \
can gain knowledge of more of the world map by exploring with an \
<link=adventurer>adventurer</link> or <link=army>army</link>, or by \
<link=trade>trading</link> maps with another kingdom (though most kingdoms are \
very hesitant to reveal what they know of the world).\n\
\n\
Traveling across the world is fastest via roads.  Traveling off-road is slower \
and may even be dangerous!  For instance, <link=jungle>jungles</link> have \
many hazards to overcome, and the heat and lack of water in deserts will wear \
down an army.  Various <link=race>races</link> fare different in different \
terrains; for instance, <link=elves>elves</link> fight and travel much more \
easily in <link=forest>forests</link> than most races.\n\

These are ruins, monster nests, and other places of interest.  Many of these \
areas can be visited and explored by armies, while others can only be fully \
explored by an adventurer.  Some may require the power of a <link=mage>mage\
</link> to fully exploit!  Be careful, because these special locations often \
contain traps, monsters, and other hazards which may kill those who dare to \
enter them.  But if these challenges can be overcome, there is almost always a \
valuable treasure or magical effect to win!\

citizens.  They are divided into three main classes: <link=peasants>peasants\
</link>, <link=merchants>merchants</link> and <link=burghers>burghers</link>.  \
Each class provides different services and fills different jobs.  Maintaining \
a mixture of all three is critical for a city to grow successfully.  Peasants \
provide physical labor, working on <link=farm>farms</link> and <link=mine>mines\
</link>, merchants provide skilled labor and help manufacture base resources \
into more valuable ones, and burghers are artisans and service workers, \
making a city stand out amongst its peers.\n\
\n\
The primary purpose of citizens is to fill jobs in <link=area>areas</link> and \
<link=building>buildings</link>.  These jobs are all tailored to a specific \
class, so some areas or buildings may be useless if you don't have available \
citizens of that class.  When citizens aren't working a job, they aren't \
idle!  They are working from their homes as seamstresses, tinkers, or other \
small odd jobs.  This produces a small amount of income which may be \
<link=taxes>taxed</link>.  Merchants generate more income than peasants, and \
burghers produce more than merchants.  Taxes are an important source of \
revenue for most cities, so it's important to balanced how many citizens you \
employ.\n\
\n\
Taxation also forms the basis of your citizens' <link=morale>morale</link>.  \
Morale is the overall happiness of your citizens, and is affected by a wide \
range of sources.  Middling morale will usually have no effects, but when it's \
very or very low the effects can be dramatic.  The most common ways to improve \
morale is by reducing taxation or giving your citizens <link=luxuries>luxuries\
</link>.\n\
\n\
Before a citizen can work a job or produce income, they have to have a home.  \
Each class lives in a different kind of <link=housing>housing</link>, and the \
housing for higher classes is more expensive than that for lower classes.  \
Housing may only be built as an <link=area>area</link>, so you will need to \
plan carefully to anticipate increase population!  Any homeless citizens will \
be unable to hold a job or produce income, but will continue to consume food \
and resources.\n\
\n\
The most important resource your citizens need is food.  The amount of food \
each citizen consumes depends on your race.  Addtionally, higher-class \
citizens eat more than lower-class ones.  If you cannot feed your citizens, \
they will begin to starve and, if the food deficit continues for long enough, \
may die.\n\
\n\
If your citizens are well-fed, they will eventually start giving birth.  A \
citizen will be born into the highest class available.  Citizen classes have \
to maintain a certain ratio.  The exact numbers depend on your race; for \
humans, there must be 10 peasants for every merchant, and 10 merchants for \
every burgher.  Addtionally, a class's morale must be above a certain level \
for the class above it to be born; this level depends on your race as well.\

Resources are valuable goods that <link=city>cities</link> can produce, \

into weapons, or traded to others.  As such, resource management is a vital \
part of city management.\n\
\n\
Resources are similar to but distinct from <link=minerals>minerals</link>.  \
Minerals are acquired strictly through <link=mining>mining</link> or trade, \
and are useless (except as an export) until <link=smeltery>smelted</link> into \
a resource form.\n\
\n\
<link=gold>Gold</link> can be considered the most basic resource.  It has no \
use of its own aside from as a currency, traded between cities, or paid to \
citizens as wages, then recollected as <link=taxes>taxes</link>.\n\
<link=food>Food</link> is the most essential resource; without it, no city can \
last for long.  Fortunately, there are a wide range of sources for food, from \
<link=farming>farming</link> to <link=hunting>hunting</link>, and it can \
always be imported if need be.\n\
<link=wood>Wood</link> and <link=stone>stone</link> are used to craft a \
variety of goods, but their most important use is in building new \
<link=area>areas</link> and <link=building>buildings</link> for your city.  A \
new city will start out with healthy amounts of both, and both can usually be \
easily acquired from the land.\n\
\n\
In addition to these four essential resources, there are many others such as \
<link=fiber>fiber</link> and <link=leather>leather</link> which are not useful \
on their own, but which can be crafted into other resources, if the correct \
building is available.\n\

Luxuries are a type of <link=resources>resource</link> which may be consumed \

</link>.  Luxuries may be a natural product, like <link=salt>salt</link>, or a \
manufactured good like <link=jewelry>jewelry</link>.\n\
\n\
Each luxury has two important values: the <c=yellow>morale<c=/> it may bestow, \
and the <c=yellow>standard demand<c=/>.  The standard demand is how many \
units, under normal circumstances, 100 citizens need to have (per day) to \
receive the full morale bonus.  Under certain circumstances, your citizens may \
demand even more, but this is rare.  The standard demand for consumable \
products (like luxury foods or drugs) tends to be rather high, since once a \
citizen receives the item they will use it up quickly.  Other more permanent \
items like <link=furniture>furniture</link> have a much lower standard demand, \
since once bought a piece may last a long time.  Luxuries with a lower \
standard demand tend to be priced more highly.\n\
\n\
Some luxuries are divided into types, such as \"coats.\"  Out of all the \
luxuries in a category, only one will be truly demanded and have the full \
standard demand and morale boost values.  The rest will have half the normal \
demand, and only earn two-fifths the normal morale.  This reflects the whims \
of fashion and popularity.  In our \"coats\" example, there are two luxuries \
that are considered to be coats; <link=fur coats>fur coats</link> and \
<link=leather coats>leather coats</link>.  If fur coats are the \
currently-fashionable choice, then leather coats will not be nearly as valued \

<link=peasants>peasants</link> find desirable may be unpopular among the \
<link=merchants>merchants</link>.  Whichever product finds its way into the \
hands of your citizens first will always be the desired product.  However, the \
winds of fashion change frequently, and every so often there is a chance for \
another currently-available luxury to take over as the preferred good.  What's \
more, other cities may use propaganda - books, traveling salesmen, etc - to \
try and persuade your citizens that a certain product (usually the one they \
produce) is the better pick!\n\
