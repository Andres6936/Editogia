Humans are natural <link=kingdom>kingdom</link>-builders, and most prefer to \

Humans are a generally friendly race, and get along well with most other \

Elves have long lives, but are slow to give birth.  Many prefer to live as \

Orcs are a nasty, brutish <link=race>race</link>, and they are proud of it.  \
Among all the races, orcs are the most eager for <link=war>conflict</link>.  \
Orcish citizens quickly grow bored if there is not a war to fight; this is the \
opposite of most races, which <link=war weariness>grow discontent during war\
</link>.  Fortunately (for them), orcs are naturally skilled in \
<link=combat>combat</link> and difficult to kill.  <c=white>Un<c=/>\
fortunately, orcs are not very skilled at crafting <link=armor>armor</link> or \
<link=weapons>weapons</link>, and will usually seek to <link=trade>buy</link> \
them from a race who can produce better than their crude equipment.\n\
Outside of combat, orcs are largely unskilled.  They are decent \
<link=mining>miners</link> and <link=forestry>woodsmen</link>, and good at the \
<link=hunting>hunt</link>, but fare poorly at other methods of obtaining \
food.  Orcs tend to have food imported, or more often, raid cities and \
<link=caravan>trade caravans</link> for their food supply.\n\
Orcs fare quite well in any terrain.  Their strength makes them better than \
most at traversing rough terrain, and they are quite happy living in \
<link=hill>hills</link> and <link=mountain>mountains</link>.  Orcs have a \
complex social structure.  While they do have a sense of loyalty to their \
<link=monarch>monarch</link> and <link=duke>dukes</link>, aggression is as \
common within an orc <link=kingdom>kingdom</link> as it is against other \
races.  Orcish cities which fail to demonstrate their success in the \
battlefield will be perceived as weak and unworthy, and it is perfectly \
socially acceptable for their neighbors to attack and destroy them.  Orcs do \
not have a typical sense of hereditary <link=succession>succession</link> as \
most races do.  Instead, a duke - or even the king or queen - is replaced when \
one of their subjects manages to invade their city and kill them.\n\
Orcs' relations with other races are ruled by might.  Orcs have respect for \
races who are skilled in combat, and nothing but contempt for those who are \
not.  The only exception is their degenerate cousins the <link=goblins>goblins\
</link> - orcs should despise these weaklings, but instead only view them with \
a mild distaste.\n\
Orcs have one of the worst affinities for <link=magic>magic</link> of all the \
races, and only very rarely does an orc take up its study.  They also fare \
very poorly in almost all <link=magical school>schools</link> of magic, the \
exceptions being <link=fire magic>fire</link> and <link=death magic>death\
</link>; and even those are only average.\

    _description("\
Goblins are a distant cousin of <link=orcs>orcs</link>, though the resemblance \
is faint.  Unlike their large, strong, vicious relatives, goblins are small in \
stature (often measuring less than four feet tall) and cowardly in nature.  \
They fare poorly in <link=combat>combat</link> and are quite easily killed.  \
However, they possess a cunning nature and make excellent <link=espionage>spies\
</link> and <link=sabotauge>saboteurs</link>.  Other <link=race>races</link> \
are wary of goblins, and rightfully so; they'll profess to be your friend, all \
the while spying on your <link=city>cities</link> and selling what they learn \
to your enemies.  If they feel they have an opportunity, goblins will happily \
backstab you for whatever reward they can reap.  Still, goblins are eager to \
find customers for their mercenary-spies, and they can be a good friend to \
have.\n\
One of the most notable traits of goblins is their \
<link=citizen reproduction>fecundity</link>.  Few races give birth in greater \
numbers than goblins do.  With this high birth rate comes a low sense of the \
value of a life; goblins don't find it particularly immoral to kill another \
goblin, and suicide missions are accepted as a fact of life.  Goblin cities \
tend to be dominated by the <link=peasants>peasant</link> population, as this \
lowly caste feels more \"natural\" to them.  Though decent as \
<link=farming>farmers</link>, goblins fare poorly at the <link=hunting>hunt\
</link>, and even worse at keeping <link=livestock>livestock</link>; they have \
absolutely no affinity for animals.\n\
Goblins actually respect and even like members of other races, in particular \
those seen as \"ugly\" by <link=humans>humans</link> and <link=elves>elves\
</link> - whom the goblins despise due to their vanity and beauty.  Goblins \
carry a particular fondness for their cousins the orcs.  Unfortunately for the \
poor goblins, almost none of these admirations are returned.\n\
Goblins are quite poor at the study of <link=magic>magic</link>, lacking both \
the patience and the depth of thought required for its mastery.  They lack an \
affinity for any of the <link=magical school>schools of magic</link>, save for \
<link=air magic>air magic</link> at which they are merely average.\

    _description("\
Ogres are a large, lumbering <link=race>race</link>, resembling a huge version \
of something from <link=humans>humans</link>' evolutionary past.  Their size \
and innate strength make them decent fighters and quite difficult to kill, but \
in fact ogres are a rather peaceful race.  The structure of their \
<link=kingdom>kingdoms</link> is rather loose, and often ogres would rather \
lead a <link=homesteaders>solitary existence</link> rather than accept the \
social contract of living in a <link=city>city</link>.\n\
Their large size gives ogres quite an appetite, and two ogres eat almost as \
much as three humans.  Fortunately for them, ogres are skilled \
<link=farming>farmers</link> and keepers of <link=livestock>livestock</link>.  \
They are good <link=forestry>woodsmen</link> as well, but their size makes it \
difficult for them to navigate <link=forest>forests</link> and other dense \
terrain.\n\
Ogres <link=citizen reproduction>give birth</link> somewhat slowly, and tend \
to live in smaller numbers than most races.  Families tend to be small but \
close-knit.\n\
Ogres get along quite well with most other races, in particular their tiny \
agrarian friends the <link=halflings>halflings</link>.  Due to their peace-\
loving ways, ogres harbor a dislike for the more warfaring races like \
<link=orcs>orcs</link>.  They're also highly distrustful of the arcane studies \
of the <link=gnomes>gnomes</link> and of the wily ways of the \
<link=goblins>goblins</link>.\n\
Ogres don't have a particularly strong affinity for <link=magic>magic</link>, \
but on the rare occasion that an ogre does undertake the study required to \
become a <link=mage>mage</link> they have a strong connection to \
<link=earth magic>earth</link>, <link=water magic>water</link> and \
<link=life magic>life</link> magic, and fare well at most others.\

    _description("\
Of all the <link=race>races</link> in the world, the trolls are without a \
doubt the most terrifying and garish.  Most races regard them as barely more \
than animals; those who are lucky enough to have never met one often think of \
them as nothing more than fairy tales to scare children.  But trolls are all \
too real, and do indeed gather to live in <link=city>settlements</link>.  \
Calling them \"cities\" may be a bit of a stretch, as they rather number more \
than a few hundred residents.  The structure of troll \"<link=kingdom>kingdoms\
</link>\" is similarly loose, with only a passing amount of rule wielded by \
the <link=monarch>monarch</link> or <link=duke>duchies</link>.\n\
Trolls are famed for being deadly in <link=combat>combat</link>.  They are not \
skilled in using or making <link=weapon>weapons</link>, but they hardly need \
them, as trolls have natural set of vicious claws and a skin that exceeds \
<link=leather armor>leather armor</link> in toughness.  They also have a \
natural regenerative ability, making <link=medic>field medics</link> totally \
unnecessary.  They use these traits to their advantage when \
<link=hunting>hunting</link>, essentially tearing through the terrain, \
devouring any creatures unlucky enough to be in their path.  However, trolls \
are totally useless at <link=farming>farming</link> and rearing \
<link=livestock>livestock</link>.  In fact, they are abysmal at most \
<link=race skills>skills</link>.  All trolls know is killing and eating.\n\
And they eat a lot - a troll eats almost as much as two <link=humans>humans\
</link> each day.  Since they <link=anthropophage>eat other races</link>, \
trolls often rely on raiding cities to kill and eat their inhabitants.  \
Despite their fast metabolism, trolls are quite slow to \
<link=citizen reproduction>reproduce</link> and tend to have very small \
cities, with most trolls living in the wilderness in a semi-feral state.\n\
Trolls see little point in <link=diplomacy>diplomacy</link> or \
<link=trade>trade</link> with non-trolls - after all, they're supposed to be \
food, not friends.  They are particularly loathe to fraternize with \
<link=dwarves>dwarves</link>, their ancient enemies.  One (slight) exception \
is the <link=orcs>orcs</link>, whose prowess in battle is respected (to a \
degree) by trolls.  Trolls are also particularly susceptible to the \
\"glamour\" of the <link=rakshasa>rakshasa</link>, viewing them with a kind of \
awe.\n\
Trolls lack the intelligence or organization to pursue <link=magic>magic\
</link>, and even if they did, they have essentially no connection to any of \
the <link=magical school>magical schools</link> besides \
<link=death magic>death magic</link>.\

Halflings are a reclusive <link=race>race</link>, small in stature (about half \

enjoying a life of leisure at home.  A halfling's favorite form of leisure is \
<link=food>eating</link>.  They have a strong appetite, and will eat as much \
as a human despite their small size.  What's more, halflings treat food as a \
<link=luxury>luxury</link> and extra rations can be assigned in the \
<link=luxury management screen>luxury management screen</link> to boost \

Fortunately for their appetites, halflings are skilled <link=farming>farmers\

    _description("\
Gnomes are a secretive, reclusive <link=race>race</link> who tend to live in \
defensible locations like <link=mountains>mountains</link> or \
<link=foothills>hills</link>.  They are the most diminuitive of all the races, \
and as a result travel tends to be quite slow when on foot (except when in \
mountains, as gnomes are quite skilled at traversing their uneven terrain).  \
Gnomes are most famous for their love of <link=gold>gold</link> and skill in \
<link=trade>trading</link> and all other forms of commerce.  However, gnomes \
are not misers, and are happy to extend a <link=loan>loan</link> to nearly \
anyone, particularly their fellow gnomes.\n\
Unfortunately, many races overlook this and tend to regard gnomes with \
suspicion and distrust.  For their part, gnomes tend to like other races, \
though they look down their noses a bit at those whom they see as \"country \
bumpkins\" like <link=ogres>ogres</link> or <link=halfling>halflings</link>.  \
Gnomes prefer to live in cities with the latest amenities and developments.  \
They are always interested in new ideas or <link=research>research</link>, and \
have a great curiousity about the world (though they are much more likely to \
pay another race for a glimpse at their <link=world map>map</link> than they \
are to explore it themselves).  On the other hand, gnomes have absolutely no \
time for the absurdity that is <link=gods>religion</link>.  They are totally \
areligious, and the gods in turn will have nothing to do with them.\n\
Their small stature means that gnomes do not need very much food at all, \
eating half as much as a human does.  It also makes them particularly weak in \
combat, and easy to kill.  However, gnomes are quite skilled with \
<link=crossbow>crossbows</link>, and the sight of a city wall lined with \
gnomic crossbowmen is enough to turn away many armies.\n\
Outside of trade, gnomes are fairly decent at most skills, though they don't \
have the patience or vigor for <link=hunting>hunting</link>.  Their society \
prizes craftsmanship above all else, and gnomic <link=citizens>citizens</link> \
tend to have as many <link=merchants>merchants</link> or \
<link=burghers>burghers</link> as <link=peasants>peasants</link>.\n\
Gnomes' strong connection to the world that they can see, touch, and study \
scientifically leaves them with a deficit in the world of <link=magic>magic\
</link>, and it is extremely rare that a gnome will take up its study.  On the \
exceptionally rare occasion that one does, they will find themselves skilled \
in <link=earth magic>earth</link> and <link=fire magic>fire</link> magic, and \
few other <link=magical school>schools</link>.\

Rakshasa are an ancient <link=race>race</link>, said to be descended from \
demons.  They resemble <link=human>humans</link> in form, but have the fur, \
head and tail of a <link=tiger>tiger</link>.  Like tigers, rakshasa are most \
at home in <link=jungle>jungles</link>, though they are also comfortable in \
other wooded areas as well as <link=mountain>mountains</link>.\n\
Rakshasa are creatures of comfort and personal freedom, and their social \
structure reflects that.  All their <link=citizens>citizens</link> demand a \
high level of <link=morale>morale</link> and relatively low <link=taxes>taxes\
</link>.  Their population also tends to have higher numbers of \
<link=merchants>merchants</link> and <link=burghers>burghers</link> than \
others, and new rakshasa cities start with several merchants.  Rakshasa's \
<link=race skills>skills</link> reflect this culture; they are generally poor \
at manual tasks, but skilled at anything that required finess or \
intelligence.  Their tiger-like nature results in a strong \
<link=hunting>hunting</link> skill, while their ability to mentally influence \
others means they are good with <link=livestock>livestock</link>.\n\
Rakshasa have a deep, innate connection to <link=magic>magic</link> and are \
the most adept spellcasters in the world.  This power goes beyond the typical \
use of <link=spell>spells</link>; rakshasa have an ever-present magical aura, \
often referred to as \"glamour,\" which manifests itself as a low-level \
psychic control over anyone who meets a rakshasa (besides other rakshasa).  As \
a result, most other races have a favorable reaction to rakshasa in \
<link=diplomacy>diplomacy</link>.  Rakshasa, for their part, are a fairly \
haughty race and tend to look down on other races, particularly those they see \
as uncultured or agrarian.  There are a few exceptions, however; \
<link=elves>elves</link> for their hauteur, <link=gnomes>gnomes</link> for \
their scientific prowess, and <link=naga>naga</link> for their affinity with \
magic.  Rakshasa consider fellow rakshasa to be beyond reproach, and attacking \
their own kind would be as unthinkable (though not unheard of) as attacking \
their own siblings.\

    _description("\
Naga are a serpentine <link=race>race</link>, creatures with a large snake-\
like tail and a <link=human>human</link> torso, albeit with four arms.  Nagas \
come in two breeds, Desert Naga and Swamp Naga.  Despite the names, the only \
difference between the two is in coloration; Desert Naga are tan and Swamp \
Naga are are green and blue.  All naga are most comfortable in \
<link=swamp>swamps</link>, but also fare quite well in <link=desert>deserts\
</link>.  Their serpentine form helps them travel rapidly in mud, water, and \
sand, but makes travel through rocky or uneven terrain quite difficult.\n\
Naga are a somewhat reclusive race, not given to lengthy foreign travel or \
invasions.  However, they are fiercely defensive of their homelands, and very \
wary of those who would enter their territory.  Naga have a strong sense of \
reverence for the land, particularly their ancestral homes of swamp and \
desert, and their attitude towards other races reflects this.  They are most \
receptive to relations with those races who share a similar respect for the \
land, or at least a peaceful nature in harmony with it, and are wary of those \
races who tend to ravage and exploit the world around them.\n\
Naga are natural philosophers and mages, and have a strong affinity for \
<link=magic>magic</link>.  They are particularly adept at the \
<link=magical school>school</link> of <link=water magic>water</link> magic, \
and are well-versed in <link=earth magic>earth</link> magic as well.  They \
have a darker nature as well, which puts them in touch with the school of \
